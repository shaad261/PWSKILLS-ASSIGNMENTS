    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. \n",
    "Data is typically arranged and displayed in tables or graphs summarizing details such as histograms, pie charts, bars or scatter plots.\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics are just descriptive and thus do not require normalization beyond the Data collected.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data. \n",
    "Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.\n",
